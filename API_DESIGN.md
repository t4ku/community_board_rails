# API Extensions

Design the REST API to satisfy the following user stories. Decide what resources you need, the HTTP methods you would use, and what is the structure of json supplied to and returned by the API.

* As a user, I want to get a list of all communities
* As a user, I want to view all posts in a specific community
* As a user, I want to post to a specific community
* As a user, I want to delete one of my posts
* As a user, I want to favourite a post, so it will appear in my list of favourite posts

* As a user, I want to subscribe to a community, so all the communities posts appear in my timeline
* As a user, I want to follow another user, so all those users posts appear in my timeline
* As a user, I want to block another user, so I never see any of those user's posts
* As a user, I want to send a message to another user
* As a user, I want to search through all the posts in the site
* As a community owner, I want to restrict access to my community to a select group of users, so we can have private discussions
